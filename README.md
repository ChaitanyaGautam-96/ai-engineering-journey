# AI Engineering Journey 🚀

This repository documents my **hands-on journey into AI and Generative AI application engineering**, focusing on building **production-grade AI-powered systems** rather than pure research.

I come from a **Java & Spring Boot backend background** and am learning how to **design, build, and integrate AI systems** into real-world applications using modern AI tooling.

This repo is updated **daily** to demonstrate consistency, learning depth, and practical implementation.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Transition from traditional backend development to **AI-powered application engineering**
- Build **LLM-based applications** using real APIs and tools
- Learn **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, embeddings, and vector databases
- Integrate AI with **Spring Boot microservices**
- Create **portfolio-ready AI projects** suitable for real-world use cases
