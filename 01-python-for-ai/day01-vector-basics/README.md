# Vector Similarity – Day 1

This example demonstrates **cosine similarity**, a core concept used in:
- Text embeddings
- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Two vectors pointing in the same direction have a similarity close to `1.0`.

This concept will later be extended to:
- Text embeddings from LLMs
- Vector databases
- AI-powered search systems
